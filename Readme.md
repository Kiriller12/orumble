## How to use

You can just add those files to your server's resource "[gamemodes]" folder and start game mode as any other game modes.

Please read notes before use!

## Important notes

There were some files that I can't include in this repo as I don't have licenses for it:
* Vehicles replacement, you can use your own modes for this, it is quite simple
* Ramp models (you can read more about this in "EXCLUDED FILES" file in models directory)

Note that game mode will not be fully functional without this ramp models, you can create your own ones or get it somwhere else.
